Having some fun with the Reddit Python API (PRAW)

You will have to create your own secret, client id, and name (user agent). Place them in a file named 'secret_stuff.txt'
in the same folder as the *.py files.

You will also need a 'stonk_tickers.txt' file in the same folder, and it should be filled with all the stock tickers
you're interested in searching for.

Right now, all modifications to the script are hard coded (i.e. changing the min count of a ticker from 30), but
if you're interested in helping improve, please feel free.
